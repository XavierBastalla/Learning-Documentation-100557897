  The article goes over on how Gpu and Cpu differ. Gpu are specialized chops that quickly render high rez images and video. while Cpu does basic computing task.
  Gpu will have mpre cores then a cpu would beaucse this would allow them to parallel processing, this will help with task that are graphic intensice like
  gaming, video editing, and machine learning. There are two type of gpu the built in one (intergraded graphic) which is in the motherborad or now mostly 
  in cpu's amd the sperate Gpu's that conncet in the PCIE slot of a motherboard. This will allow the user to access the Gpu resoucres.

  Keypoints:

the main difference between a CPU and a GPU

the two main types of GPUs

common use cases for GPUs today

cloud GPU and how does it differ from a traditional GPU deployment

Personal insights or reflections:

I knew the basic info on Gpu but reading this it nice to know the difference how a gpu works both externally and internally
