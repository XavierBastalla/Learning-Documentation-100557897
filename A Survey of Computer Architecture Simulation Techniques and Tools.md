What is emulsiV?

emulsiV is a Visula sumulator that show a simple RISC processor that is referd as Virgule or RISC-V. The main purpose of emulsiV is a Simulaltor that shows 
(The user interface shows the structure of the datapath and animates the data transfers between functional units. The execution of a single instruction is decomposed into several steps (fetch, decode, ALU, mem/reg, PC) for educational reasons, but the intent is not to reflect a specific sequencer or pipeline implementation. In fact, we don't plan to simulate a pipeline in more detail.) re word this
