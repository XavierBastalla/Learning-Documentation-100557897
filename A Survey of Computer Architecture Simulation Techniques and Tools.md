What is emulsiV?

emulsiV is a Visula sumulator that show a simple RISC processor that is referd as Virgule or RISC-V. The main purpose of emulsiV is a Simulaltor that it is used as a teaching tool
it teaches the user about comupter architecture and digital design at ESEO. The interface itself show the structure of datapath and plays a small anamations to show the data being
transfered from one funcatioal unit to a other. it will also show how the data and its instructions are stores, show the exeuction steps of the instucations, will show how data will
move between funcatinal units and the basic IO mechansisms and interrputs.

Advantages:

Viusal: The sim will allow anyone who is using it to see in real time what is happining within the processor when it excuting an instucation and can make changes.

Aid: since this is a teaching tool this will give the peopel view it a more indeth info. they are able to to control the sim and stop at certan time or change the speed to see what it happening within the processor 

easy of use : The sim is very easy to use the user can change any vaule they want. it also easy to follow with the animations turned on it will show where the data is heading and what is being changed. 
also gives you exmplaes to view and review 

Disadvantages:

Accessibility: while this can be seen as an advantage not having the the equipment and access to internet with out these you will not be able to use the sim at all

Accuracy: the sim is a teaching tool for beginner so a lot of whats being shown is dumb down to the basic info to get an idea of what its happening

Comparison with Traditional Tools:

The traditional tool i will compare emulsiV to is a digram on paper. emilsiV compared to a normal digram is far superior with the sim you are able to see how the process works, with the digram it would show each of the parts and what it does.
with the digram it will give you the run down of the what the step by step process will be, the sim will show you how it works. you can also edit the speed in which it does so, turn the aniamtions to see where each of the data is heading. Also 
the sim will give you muitple examples it could run, giving you different ways it runs.
