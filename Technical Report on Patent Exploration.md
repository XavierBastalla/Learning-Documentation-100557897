Summary of the Patent
===
Key Components and Technologies
-
Multip-GPU

- Since the system would have mutiple Gpu they can distribute the workload between the both of them. This allows more complex and detailed graphics to be rendered much more 
quickly compared to a single GPU

Frame Buffer Management

- This manages the frame buffer across the GPU, this will ensure that each of the GPU can access the data they need without delays. This would also help maintaining high frame rates and reducing latency

Load Balancing

- The system will assign rendering task based off of the current workload, this optimizies the system

Scalability

  - the overall system was desgined to be scalable. This will allow the user to be able to install other GPU to increase the performance

Innovations
=
Improved Rendering Efficiency

- By allowing the workload to be spread out the muitlple Gpu they system can handle a much larger workload. This incudles
  more complex scenes, resolutions without giving up on performance.

Enhanced Real-Time Processing

- The patent states methods the help the muilt-GPU system can render in real-time, this helps applications where delay can impact the user

Advanced Synchronization Techniques

- Helps prevents issues like tearing and stuttering which can occur when having more then one Gpu that are not sunchronized

Adaptability to Different Workloads

- Helps adapt to the different workload
