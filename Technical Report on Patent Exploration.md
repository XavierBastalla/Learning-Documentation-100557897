What is Multi-GPU rendering system and it relevance
====================================================
This patent goes over a multi-GPU renderding ststem to enhance performance and efficintcive of graphics but have multiple GPU in the systems. How this is 
relevancet is that this pantent is significant for applications that require high computational power like gaming, virtual reality and real time rendering.

Summary of the Patent
===
Key Components and Technologies
-
Multip-GPU

- Since the system would have mutiple Gpu they can distribute the workload between the both of them. This allows more complex and detailed graphics to be rendered much more 
quickly compared to a single GPU

Frame Buffer Management

- This manages the frame buffer across the GPU, this will ensure that each of the GPU can access the data they need without delays. This would also help maintaining high frame rates and reducing latency

Load Balancing

- The system will assign rendering task based off of the current workload, this optimizies the system

Scalability

  - the overall system was desgined to be scalable. This will allow the user to be able to install other GPU to increase the performance

Innovations
=
Improved Rendering Efficiency

- By allowing the workload to be spread out the muitlple Gpu they system can handle a much larger workload. This incudles
  more complex scenes, resolutions without giving up on performance.

Enhanced Real-Time Processing

- The patent states methods the help the muilt-GPU system can render in real-time, this helps applications where delay can impact the user

Advanced Synchronization Techniques

- Helps prevents issues like tearing and stuttering which can occur when having more then one Gpu that are not sunchronized

Adaptability to Different Workloads

- Helps adapt to the different workload

Analysis
=

How this pentant has effectived the current computer architecture is how much Gpus and render the image and video data. Over the year technologies has adavanated so much that we are starting to see application that look like they are real life
(exmaple of a game called unrecord that uses the unreal ENGINE 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtWDd-YWZ0)
Hence the GPU also needed to be upgrade, but as the years went by the GPU didnt need a second gpu to help with the huge workload. Within the pentent the key compents and technologies have been improved to a great to degree today but some were left behind.
Frame buffering, load balancing have increased and to a degree scalability, while having the need for mutiple Gpu is no longer required. how this will have a potential impact on future developments is i believe where we wont need a card for a gpu and we
can just relay on the gpu in the cpu to do the the task that requires for image and video data. We have already starting to see that, there have been Cpu's that are being compared score wise to Nividas 1050 series and up cards.
